1. Suppose that the hourly wage W has a gamma distribution. Suppose that the mean value E(W) of this variable is 20 USD per hour and 
the standard deviation σ(W) is 5 USD.

Recall that for gamma distribution W ∼ Gamma(α,λ)
      E(W) = α/λ, V ar(W) = α/λ^2 
      
Suppose that in the setting of the two envelope problem the job offer is applied not to annual salaries, but to hourly wages. 
The open envelope has an offer of 18 USD per hour. Calculate the values of the distribution density f(w) for w = 9 and w = 36 ?

• 2. Suppose that the sample of human life lengths in years provided on the companion website in the file survival.xlsx comes from a 
Gamma(α,λ) distribution. Estimate it using MLE and the method of moments. Compare the results.

• 3. Suppose that the sample of human life lengths in years provided in the file survival.xlsx comes from a Weibull(λ,τ) distribution. 
Estimate its parameters using MLE 

• 4. For the following problem of deciding between two simple hypotheses (nor-mal with unknown mean and known variance) by a sample of
size 1 (single observation), H 0 : N(0,1) versus simple alternative H 1 : N(2,1) use the test statistic chi square and determine its 
critical region for 
(a) Classical test with significance level 0.05 (also, what is the power of this test?)
(b) Bayesian test with prior probability P(H 0 ) = 3/4 using posterior odds 1:1.

• 5. Suppose that a single observation is to be drawn from the following p.d.f.:f(x|θ) = (θ + 1)x −(θ+2) , 1 ≤ x < ∞, where the value 
of θ is unknown.Suppose that the following hypotheses are to be tested: null hypothesis H 0 : θ =0 versus simple alternative H 1 : θ = 1
